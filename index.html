      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <hr>

      <img id="bio-image" src="assets/images/Me&MB.jpg" alt="My wife and I at a UW football game" />

      <p>Father of three grown children, husband, 30-year Army veteran and retiree, and amateur photographer
        with a special interest in underwater photography of marine life. My wife's name is Mary Beth---so nice they
        named her twice! We have one cat (Buddy), and a part-time dog (Cassie) that we share with the family that
        takes care of her most of the time.</p>

      <p>During my military career, I deployed several times to serve the Nation. I was serving at the Pentagon on 9/11
        and the hijackled jet flew right underneath my office. I've had the good fortune over my lifetime of visiting
        42 countries, and I hope to add to this list in the coming years!</p>
